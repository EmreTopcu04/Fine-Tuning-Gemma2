# Fine-Tuning Gemma2 for Turkish

This notebook focuses on fine-tuning the Gemma2 language model to enable effective processing of Turkish inputs. The objective is to enhance the model's capability to understand and generate structured, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses in Turkish.

## Objectives

- Adapt Gemma2 to handle Turkish-specific linguistic nuances.
- Ensure the model responds with high accuracy and proper structure.
- Create a fine-tuned version of Gemma2 optimized for Turkish NLP tasks.

## Prerequisites

Before running this notebook, ensure you have the following:

- A Python environment with TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the framework used for fine-tuning).
- A dataset of Turkish text for training and evaluation.
- Sufficient computational resources (e.g., a GPU-enabled environment).
